    const overview = ref(`
      Real-Time Software Engineering involves designing and developing software systems 
      that respond to inputs or events within a guaranteed time constraint. These systems
      are commonly used in critical applications where timely and predictable responses 
      are essential.
    `)
    //into
    const intro = ref(`
      A real-time system is a software system that must deliver correct results at the correct time.
      
      ÔÇ∑ Example: A pacemaker must detect heartbeat irregularities and respond immediately; 
        delay can be life-threatening.
     
      ‚úÖ Types:
        ÔÇ∑ Hard Real-Time System
            The system fails if deadlines are missed.
            ‚û§ Example: Anti-lock braking system in cars
        ÔÇ∑ Soft Real-Time System
            The system‚Äôs quality degrades, but it still works.
            ‚û§ Example: Video streaming (a slight lag may occur but it continues running)
    `) 

    //embedded system
    const ES = ref(`
      An embedded system is a combination of hardware and software designed for a specific function 
      within a larger system.

      üîß Characteristics:
            ÔÇ∑ Operate continuously (e.g., washing machine controller)
            ÔÇ∑ Must react to unpredictable real-world stimuli
            ÔÇ∑ Include direct interaction with hardware (e.g., sensors, actuators)
            ÔÇ∑ Often stored in read-only memory
      üß† Example:
        A smart thermostat that reads room temperature and controls the heater accordingly.
    `) 

    //Responsiveness and Timing
    const RT = ref(`
      The key challenge in real-time systems is ensuring a timely reaction to events.

      üß† Example:
        In a fire alarm system, detecting smoke must immediately trigger:     
            ÔÇ∑ The alarm siren
            ÔÇ∑ Sprinklers
            ÔÇ∑ And possibly call emergency services
    `) 

    //Reactive System and Stimuli
    const RSS = ref(`
      üîÑ Periodic Stimuli
        Generated at regular intervals
        ‚û§ Example: Polling a temperature sensor every 100ms

      ‚ö° Aperiodic Stimuli
        Occur unexpectedly and require immediate attention
        ‚û§ Example: A power surge detected by the system
        
      Real-time systems react to these stimuli with appropriate responses within a guaranteed time frame.
    `) 

    //Architectural Pattern in Real-Time System
    const APRTS = ref(`
      üß† a) Observe and React Pattern
            ÔÇ∑ Continuously monitors sensor values
            ÔÇ∑ Reacts when thresholds are met
        üß™ Example: A smoke detector activates an alarm when smoke concentration is above the safe limit.

      üåç b) Environmental Control Pattern
            ÔÇ∑ Collects data from environment
            ÔÇ∑ Makes decisions to change the environment
        üå°Ô∏è Example: A greenhouse system opens vents when it gets too hot and waters plants at set times.

      üîó c) Process Pipeline Pattern
           ÔÇ∑ Transforms input step-by-step into output
           ÔÇ∑ Each stage processes and passes data to the next
       üî¨ Example: A radiation detector reads signals ‚Üí amplifies ‚Üí filters noise ‚Üí logs readings.
    `)

    //designing an embedded system 
    const DES = ref(`
      The design process for real-time systems involves:
        ÔÇ∑ Platform Selection: Choose the microcontroller, OS, and tools
        ÔÇ∑ Stimuli/Response Identification: What events will the system handle?
        ÔÇ∑ Timing Analysis: Ensuring responses are on time
        ÔÇ∑ Process Scheduling: When and how often should each task run?
    `)

    //timing analysis
    const TA = ref(`
      Ensures the system meets deadlines under worst-case conditions.
      üìä Key Factors:
        ÔÇ∑ Deadline: Max allowed time for a task
        ÔÇ∑ Execution Time: Time needed to complete a task
        ÔÇ∑ Frequency: How often a task should run

      Example:
        In a power failure detector:
        ÔÇ∑ Voltage must be checked every 4ms
        ÔÇ∑ If 3 consecutive drops are detected, battery backup must start
        ÔÇ∑ The backup must be fully active within 50ms
        ‚Üí This requires precise scheduling and fast execution
    `)

    //real-time operating system 
    const RTOS = ref(`
      An RTOS manages tasks and ensures timely and predictable task execution.
     üß† Components:
        ÔÇ∑ Scheduler: Picks the next process to run
        ÔÇ∑ Interrupt Handler: Deals with aperiodic events
        ÔÇ∑ Dispatcher: Starts a task
        ÔÇ∑ Resource Manager: Allocates CPU and memory
        ÔÇ∑ Real-Time Clock: Controls task timing

     üõ†Ô∏è Example RTOS:
        ÔÇ∑ VxWorks
        ÔÇ∑ FreeRTOS
        ÔÇ∑ RTEMS
    `)

    //Process and priority management
    const PPM = ref(`
      ÔÇ∑ Periodic processes: Run at regular intervals
      ÔÇ∑ Interrupt-driven processes: Triggered by events

     üß† Priority Levels:
        ÔÇ∑ Interrupt Level: Highest; for urgent events
        ÔÇ∑ Clock Level: For regular scheduled tasks
    `)

    //scheduling strategies
    const SS = ref(`
      ÔÇ∑ Non-Preemptive: Once a process starts, it runs to completion
      ÔÇ∑ Preemptive: Higher-priority processes can interrupt others
        
      Common Algorithms:
        ÔÇ∑ Round-Robin: Equal time slices
        ÔÇ∑ Rate Monotonic: More frequent tasks get higher priority
        ÔÇ∑ Shortest Deadline First: Task with nearest deadline runs first

     üß† Case Study Example: Burglar Alarm System
        üè† System Behavior:
            ÔÇ∑ Sensors detect movement, open windows/doors
            ÔÇ∑ Alarm triggers lights, audible sound, and calls the police
            ÔÇ∑ Switches to battery backup if power is lost

        üß† Timing Requirements:
            ÔÇ∑ Power failure must be addressed in 50ms
            ÔÇ∑ System polls sensors every 0.25s

     ‚Üí These constraints guide timing analysis and scheduling
